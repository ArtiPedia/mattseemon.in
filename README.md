# mattseemon.in

This is the source code for my personal site, portofolio and blog [mattseemon.in](https://mattseemon.in). The site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

## User experience
For the user experience, I decided to use [bootstap](https://getbootstrap.com) framework to make it responsive and [Minimal](https://github.com/calintat/minimal) theme by [Calin Tataru](https://github.com/calintat/) for the look and feel.
