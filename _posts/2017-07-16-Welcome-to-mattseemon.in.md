Finally after more than two years, we are finally here. **So where is here you may ask?** :smile:

Well, honestly this goes back at least six to seven years. Having worked at a few global IT firms for over 10 years, I was seriously contemplating my choices in life, career, etc.

This eventually led me to trying out different things, I had, over the year grown interested in. This led to a journey of self discovery for me. In the last 5 years, I have tried quite a few new things.

 * Started doing Voice-Overs
 * Started hosting Karaoke
 * Do a bit of theater. Try to do at least one play a year
 * Learnt to swim
 * Learnt to Jive
 * Travel more often
 * Adopted two dogs :heart:
 * Started piano lessons (Need more practice)
 * Started surfing lessons (Need more practice)
 * Started to learn Spanish

Now I make it a point to try my hand at something new and learn a new skill every year and also travel a much as I can financially afford.

The objective of this site is pretty simple, I wanted a simple, effective and professional way to be able to present myself, from my work to my passion, to my ramblings, to the world.

This will be my primary platform, where I will update you with what the latest in my life.

So, where do I go from here. Checkout out what I am doing right [/now](/now).
